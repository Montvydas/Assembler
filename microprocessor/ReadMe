I have coded the function of the microprocessor, the file includes the .v file and simulation file

==============to achieve the simple test to this microprocessor, u can do the following changes to this program================
1. invalid the initial txt part in both ROM and RAM module
2. valid the initialize part written by me in both ROM and RAM module ( I have written a small test software in ROM in this module)
3. run the simulation for 5ms or more, zoom the output, if the register A is 11111111 and register B is 11111110 after the interrupt, the microprocessor is runned corrrectly
4. you can initialize the ROM and RAM by yourselves to do another test



==============some point to note=========================
1. I have increased the frequency of Time by 10 times for simulation easilier, u can change the Timer.v file to decrease it to 1Hz
2. The interrupt in this project I used is the interrupt created by Timer
