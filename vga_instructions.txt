//This is where the interrupt starts
//store_val F3 00	//diable interrupts

load a 00	//get value of 01
load b 01	//get value of color

add a b		//add two to get incremented value

store 01 a	//store addition back into the colour
store B0 a	//store current colour into these addresses for vga
//store_val F3 01	//enable interrupts back
store F0 a	//update the processor with a new timer value

//interrupt timer has 32 bits, meaning ~50 days of working before reseting the timer
//for F0: store F0 (anything)				//update the processor with a new timer value
//for F1: store F1 (new interrupt rate in millis) 	//default should be 100, so need to set this in the Timer.v
//for F2: store F2 01 					//to reset the timer in the processor
//for F3: store F3 XX 					//01 - enable interrupts & 00 - disable interrupts


goto_idle	//wait for another interrupt


//This is how the program could be changed 
/*
load a 00	//get the colour value
incr a a	//increment a & store in a reg

store 01 a
store B0 a
store F0 a
